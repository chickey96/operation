# Operation

A game of anatomy.

## Background and Overview

Operation is an interactive game that doubles as an anatomy lesson. Users click and drag organ icons to implant them in a human body. 

## Functionality

* Users can click and drag organ images on the canvas
* Organs lock into place when correctly positioned
* A congratulatory modal displays the name of the organ when correctly placed
* A health bar increments proportionally with the number of organs placed
* Once all organs are implanted, users have the option to replay the game
